This is a platform that recognizes A , B and C in American Sign Language. 
I made the dataset and trained the model myself to obtain the best results.I have used mediapipe and cvzone to detect hand in the OpenCV window.Moreover , I have also made a simple simulation of a person that points to the detected letter on a board .
